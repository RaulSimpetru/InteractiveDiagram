# InteractiveDiagram
This is a python script that can produce a interactive matplotlib plot in order to visualise rents in a city. 
Right now it has a lot of hardcoded information that I will like to improve in the future even though it has started only as an experiment.
### Prerequisites
pandas, geocoder, numpy, matplotlib
